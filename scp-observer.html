          <p>
            A containment breach has unleashed several SCP entities, leaving
            you—a maintenance technician—trapped in a solitary "safe room." Your
            routine task of reviewing electronic devices has suddenly become a
            desperate struggle for survival.
          </p>
          <p>
            As chaos unfolds around you, your mission is clear: manage dwindling
            power supplies and utilize surveillance equipment to keep the
            horrifying entities at bay. Every decision is critical as you work
            to maintain the integrity of your sanctuary until help arrives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drawing inspiration from the atmospheric tension of Five Nights at
            Freddy's and the expansive lore of SCP - Containment Breach, SCP:
            Observer plunges you into a heart-pounding race against time. Your
            skills, wit, and nerve will be tested to their limits as you face
            the terror that lurks just beyond your walls.
          </p>
          <p>Will you endure long enough for rescue to reach you?</p>
